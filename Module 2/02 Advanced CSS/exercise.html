                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                " Before joining the bootcamp, I've
                never written a line of code. I needed
                some structure from professionals
                who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to
                enroll by a former student of theirs
                who can only say wonderful things
                about the program, The entire
                curriculum and staff did not
                disappoint. They were very hands-on
                and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took
                my learning to the next level in a way
                that no tutorial could ever have. In
                fact, I've often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my
                developent experience, It certainly
                helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple
                offers. 100% recommend! "
